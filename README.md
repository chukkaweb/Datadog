# Datadog
Absolutely! Here's your end-to-end guide to learning Datadog in simple points, designed like a study roadmap with important notes + examples.

# ✅ What is Datadog?

Datadog is a monitoring, logging, and observability platform for cloud-scale applications.
It helps DevOps, SRE, and developers to:

* Monitor metrics
* Analyze logs
* Visualize dashboards
* Alert on system behaviors


## 1️⃣ Core Concepts

| Term          | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Metric    | A time-series data point (e.g., CPU usage = 70%)     |
| Log       | A raw event/text generated by apps or systems        |
| Trace     | A single request's journey across services           |
| Monitor   | A rule that watches a metric/log and triggers alerts |
| Dashboard | Visual panel showing graphs, metrics, status         |


## 3️⃣ Metrics Monitoring

💡 Use metrics to monitor:

* CPU, memory, disk
* Network usage
* Custom app metrics

### Example:

View `system.cpu.user` on a dashboard or setup alert if > 80%.

---

## 4️⃣ Dashboards

Create custom dashboards using:

* Graphs (line, bar, heatmap)
* Top lists
* Monitors
* Status widgets

🧠 Use case: Show a dashboard with:

* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Error count per service

---

## 5️⃣ Monitors & Alerts

Create Monitors for automated alerts.

### Types:

* Metric Monitor
* Log Monitor
* APM Monitor
* Synthetic Monitor (API tests)

### 📢 Example:

"Send alert if `host:app-server` CPU > 90% for 5 minutes"

```plaintext
Trigger: avg(last_5m):avg:system.cpu.user{host:app-server} > 90
```

✅ Alerts via:

* Slack
* Email
* PagerDuty

---

## 6️⃣ Log Management

Datadog can collect logs via:

* Agent (file logs)
* Sidecar (containers)
* Cloud integrations (e.g., AWS CloudWatch)

### 🛠 Example config:

```yaml
logs:
  - type: file
    path: /var/log/nginx/access.log
    service: nginx
    source: nginx
```

✅ You can then:

* View logs in Log Explorer
* Filter by tags
* Setup Log monitors

---

## 7️⃣ APM (Application Performance Monitoring)

Use APM to trace requests across microservices.

### How it works:

* Install language-specific libraries (e.g., `ddtrace`)
* Configure tracer in your app
* View traces and spans in UI

### 🧪 Example:

You can trace a request:

* frontend → API Gateway → User Service → DB

It shows latency per step.

---

## 8️⃣ Synthetic Monitoring

✅ Test website, APIs, and endpoints

Types:

* HTTP test (check 200 OK)
* Browser test (simulate login UI)

### Example:

```bash
Create HTTP test for https://myapp.com/login
Assert status = 200 and text = "Welcome"
```

---

## 9️⃣ Service Map

Visualizes services and dependencies.

✅ You’ll see:

* Arrows between services
* Color-coded latency and error rates

---

## 🔟 Integrations

Datadog supports 600+ integrations.

Popular ones:

* AWS / Azure / GCP
* Docker / Kubernetes
* Redis / PostgreSQL
* Jenkins / GitHub

### Example:

For AWS:

```bash
Use IAM role + cloudformation to send CloudWatch metrics
```

---

## 🔁 11. Tags and Filtering

Use tags to organize data:

```plaintext
env:prod, team:backend, region:us-west
```

✅ You can filter dashboards or alerts based on tags.

---

## ✅ 12. Best Practices

| Practice               | Description                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Use tags               | Helps filtering & grouping   |
| Aggregate data         | Reduce noise in dashboards   |
| Set alert thresholds   | Avoid alert fatigue          |
| Use template variables | For reusable dashboards      |
| Monitor SLOs           | Focus on reliability targets |

---

## ✅ 13. Sample Real-Time Use Case

Problem: A website is slowing down

### Solution with Datadog:

1. View APM trace → Find delay in `payment-service`
2. View metrics → See CPU spike on payment container
3. Check logs → Error in payment gateway config
4. Fix + deploy → Monitor alert clears
